# Data-Visualization

Based on the contents of the `Plots.py` and `data.py` files, I'll draft a `README.md` file that outlines the purpose and functionality of these Python scripts:

# Stock Data Visualization Tool

This project comprises a set of Python scripts designed to analyze and visualize stock market data. It uses `matplotlib` for generating insightful plots that represent various aspects of stock performance over time.

## Features

- Generate bar charts to showcase the adjusted closing prices of stocks.
- Create horizontal bar charts that compare the opening and closing prices.
- Utilize pie charts to represent the distribution of high, low, and volume data points.
- Plot time series data to analyze trends in stock adjustments.
- Fill area charts for visualizing stock volume changes.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `csv` libraries installed in your Python environment.
2. Place your stock data in CSV format within the same directory as the scripts.
3. Run `data.py` to load and format your data appropriately.
4. Execute `Plots.py` to create and view the visualizations.

## Data Format

The `data.py` script expects a CSV file with the following columns:

- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adj_Close
- Volume

Ensure your CSV follows this format for the scripts to function correctly.

## Visualization Output

The plots generated by `Plots.py` will be saved to a dynamically named directory based on the current date and time, ensuring that each visualization session is neatly organized and timestamped for future reference.
